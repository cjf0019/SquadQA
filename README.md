# Squad Question Answering Pytorch Pipelines

Pipeline to train a question-answering bot from the SQUAD dataset using the T5 model. Implementation was done using Pytorch Lightning and the HuggingFace Transformers library. I'd like to acknowledge Venelin Valkov and his helpful video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6XY80Z9eSA, which helped me formulate the backbone of the Pytorch Lightning code.
